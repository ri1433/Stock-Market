this is a webpage for a stock market dashboard. It is done using React.js and css- tailwind library.
To run the code a valid API key must be added to the env file. This API key can be generated from alpha vantage. 
Then to run it, type npm start and the code should run fetching the real time data. in interest of time I was only able to add dummy values for the other data visible but the chart data is live data using the alpha
vantage API key.
